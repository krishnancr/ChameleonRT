# ImGui Implementation Plans for ChameleonRT SlangDisplay

This directory contains comprehensive implementation plans for integrating Dear ImGui with ChameleonRT's Slang backend.

## Overview

The plans provide two different approaches to implementing ImGui rendering through Slang GFX:

- **Plan A**: Unified Slang GFX implementation (recommended)
- **Plan B**: Native backends with Slang interop (Falcor-style)

## Plan Comparison

| Aspect | Plan A (Unified Slang) | Plan B (Native Backends) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Complexity** | Higher initial implementation | Lower initial implementation |
| **Maintenance** | Single codebase for all APIs | Separate code paths per API |
| **Performance** | Slight abstraction overhead | Native performance |
| **Features** | Custom implementation needed | Full ImGui features immediately |
| **Future-Proofing** | Automatic new API support | Manual porting required |
| **Debugging** | Custom pipeline debugging | Well-documented backends |

## Recommendation

**Start with Plan A (Unified Slang GFX)** because:
- Matches SlangDisplay's architectural philosophy
- Single implementation works across Vulkan, D3D12, and future APIs
- Better long-term maintainability
- Educational value in understanding graphics pipelines

Plan B is provided as a fallback if Plan A encounters technical challenges.

### Documentation
- [`README.md`](README.md) - This overview file

## Quick Start

### For Plan A Implementation:
```bash
# 1. Start with foundation
# Follow Plan A Stage 1: Foundation Setup and Shader Creation

# 2. Create the renderer class
# Implement SlangImGuiRenderer class structure

# 3. Work through stages sequentially
# Each stage builds on the previous one

# 4. Test each checkpoint before proceeding
# Validate implementation at each stage
```

### For Plan B Implementation:
```bash
# 1. Setup native interop
# Follow Plan B Stage 1: Native Handle Extraction Infrastructure

# 2. Initialize native backends
# Setup Dear ImGui's official Vulkan/D3D12 backends

# 3. Synchronize with Slang GFX
# Handle command buffer lifecycle properly

# 4. Integrate with SlangDisplay
# Complete end-to-end integration
```

## Plan Structure

Each plan is organized into sequential stages:

### Stage Components
- **Objective**: Clear goal for the stage
- **Tasks**: Specific work items to complete
- **Implementation Details**: Complete code examples and explanations
- **Checkpoints**: Validation points for incremental testing
- **Test Scenario**: Specific testing approach
- **Test Commands**: Space for actual build/run commands _(to be filled manually)_
- **Final Acceptance Criteria**: Success metrics _(to be filled manually)_

### Working with Stages
1. **Read entire stage** before starting implementation
2. **Follow tasks in order** - they build on each other
3. **Validate all checkpoints** before proceeding
4. **Document test commands** as you create them
5. **Define acceptance criteria** based on your requirements

## Implementation Timeline

### Plan A (Unified Slang) - Estimated 5-7 days
- Stage 1: Foundation Setup (1 day)
- Stage 2: Shader Compilation (1 day)
- Stage 3: Buffer Management (1-2 days)
- Stage 4: Font and Pipeline (1 day)
- Stage 5: Render Implementation (1-2 days)
- Stage 6: Integration & Testing (1 day)

### Plan B (Native Backends) - Estimated 3-5 days
- Stage 1: Native Interop (1 day)
- Stage 2: Backend Init (1 day)
- Stage 3: Synchronization (1 day)
- Stage 4: Integration (1 day)
- Stage 5: Testing (1 day)

## Prerequisites

Before starting either plan, ensure you have:

### Code Dependencies
- Slang GFX properly integrated in ChameleonRT
- Dear ImGui library available
- Working Vulkan or D3D12 build configuration

### Development Tools
- Graphics debugger (RenderDoc, PIX, etc.)
- Memory profiler for leak detection
- Performance profiling tools

### Knowledge Requirements
- Familiarity with Slang GFX API
- Understanding of graphics pipeline concepts
- Basic knowledge of ImGui integration patterns

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All ImGui widgets render correctly
- [ ] UI responds to input properly
- [ ] Text rendering is crisp and clear
- [ ] Works on both Vulkan and D3D12

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Maintains 60+ FPS with typical UI load
- [ ] ImGui rendering overhead < 1ms per frame
- [ ] Memory usage stable during extended operation
- [ ] No validation errors in debug builds

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Graceful error handling
- [ ] Proper resource cleanup
- [ ] Code follows project standards

## Getting Help

### Using GitHub Copilot
See [`github-copilot-usage-guide.md`](github-copilot-usage-guide.md) for detailed instructions on using these plans with AI assistance.

### Common Issues
- **Shader compilation errors**: Check Slang version compatibility
- **Handle extraction failures**: Verify Slang GFX interop API usage
- **Performance issues**: Profile with graphics debugger
- **Memory leaks**: Use debug runtime and profilers

### Debugging Tips
- Enable all validation layers during development
- Use graphics debuggers to verify command streams
- Test with simple UI cases before complex ones
- Validate resource creation/destruction carefully
