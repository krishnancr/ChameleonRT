# Phase 2A - Quick Start Guide

**Want to get started immediately?** Follow these 5 simple steps.

---

## Step 1: Read SUMMARY.md ‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes

Open `SUMMARY.md` in this directory to understand:
- What was created
- How the 5 prompts work
- What you'll accomplish

---

## Step 2: Read README.md ‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes

Open `README.md` in this directory to learn:
- How to use the prompts
- Expected timeline
- Success criteria

---

## Step 3: Open INDEX.md ‚è±Ô∏è 2 minutes

Keep `INDEX.md` open as your tracking sheet:
- Quick reference to all prompts
- Status checkboxes to track progress
- Common issues reference

---

## Step 4: Start Phase 2A.0 ‚è±Ô∏è 2-3 hours

1. Open `Phase_2A.0_Preparation_Analysis.md`
2. Read through it once (5-10 minutes)
3. Copy the ENTIRE file content
4. Paste into GitHub Copilot Chat
5. Follow Copilot's guidance through all tasks
6. Create deliverables in `../Phase2A_Analysis/`
7. Manually capture baseline screenshots

**Result:** You'll understand the current architecture and have baselines

---

## Step 5: Continue Sequential Execution

After 2A.0 is complete, repeat the process for:
- Phase 2A.1: CPU Scene Refactor
- Phase 2A.2: DXR Backend Refactor (includes BLAS pause point)
- Phase 2A.3: Vulkan Backend Refactor (includes BLAS pause point)
- Phase 2A.4: Final Validation

---

## Important Reminders

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Sequential Execution Required
Don't skip phases. Each builds on the previous.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation Is Critical
Don't proceed to next phase if current phase tests fail.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pause Points Are Mandatory
Phases 2A.2 and 2A.3 have CRITICAL ANALYSIS POINTS. Stop and analyze before implementing.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Document Everything
Create all the specified deliverables. They're important for debugging and validation.

## Total Time Investment

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|------------|
| 2A.0  | 2-3h     | 2-3h       |
| 2A.1  | 2-4h     | 4-7h       |
| 2A.2  | 4-6h     | 8-13h      |
| 2A.3  | 4-6h     | 12-19h     |
| 2A.4  | 2-3h     | 14-22h     |

**Recommended:** Break into multiple work sessions, commit after each phase.

## First Time Using These Prompts?

### Do This:
1. ‚úÖ Read SUMMARY.md (understand what was created)
2. ‚úÖ Read README.md (understand how to use them)
3. ‚úÖ Review Phase2A_GlobalBuffers_Plan.md (understand the goal)
4. ‚úÖ Start with Phase 2A.0 (begin execution)

### Don't Do This:
- ‚ùå Skip reading the documentation
- ‚ùå Jump to Phase 2A.2 without doing 2A.0 and 2A.1
- ‚ùå Ignore the pause points
- ‚ùå Skip validation steps
