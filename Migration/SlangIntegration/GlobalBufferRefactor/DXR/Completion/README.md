## 🎯 Quick Navigation

**I want to...**

- **Understand what Phase 1 accomplished** → Read `PHASE1_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- **See the full implementation journey** → Read `PHASE1_CONSOLIDATED_COMPLETE.md`
- **Know what changed in the code** → See "Final Implementation" section in consolidated doc
- **Understand why we moved textures to t30** → See "Iteration 6" in consolidated doc
- **See validation output** → Search for "Validation Output" in either doc
- **Know what's next** → See "Next Steps: Phase 2" in either doc

## 📊 Status

- ✅ **Phase 1:** Shader declarations and CPU data structures (COMPLETE)
- ⏳ **Phase 2:** Create GPU buffers and upload data (NEXT)
- ⏳ **Phase 3:** Bind global buffers to descriptor table
- ⏳ **Phase 4:** Switch pipeline to use `ClosestHit_GlobalBuffers`
- ⏳ **Phase 5:** Remove old space1 local root signature code

## 🔑 Key Achievement

Successfully established Slang-compatible global buffer architecture:
- ✅ Global buffers in space0 (t10-t14)
- ✅ Offset-based indexing (not local root signatures)
- ✅ Separate arrays matching original DXR layout
- ✅ Compiles without `-Vd` flag
- ✅ Validated with console output
- ✅ Application runs successfully

**Foundation is solid - ready for Phase 2!** 🚀
