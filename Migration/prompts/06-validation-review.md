# Validation & Code Review Prompts

## Overview

Use these prompts to validate your work at each integration phase.

**Use these when:** You've completed a set of changes and want to ensure quality before moving on.

**Pattern:** Paste the relevant validation prompt for your current phase.

## Using These Prompts

**When to validate:**
- After completing each phase
- Before committing changes
- At decision gate milestones
- When uncertain about quality

**How to use:**
1. Copy relevant validation prompt
2. Fill in your specific status/results
3. Paste into Copilot Chat
4. I'll review against best practices

**What I'll check:**
- Completeness (did you finish the phase?)
- Correctness (does it work as intended?)
- Quality (follows conventions, no shortcuts?)
- Readiness (safe to proceed to next phase?)

**Example flow:**

Week 2 (Phase 1 complete):
1. You paste "Week 2 Decision Gate" prompt with your status
2. I review: "DXR âœ“, Vulkan âœ“, dual compilation âœ“"
3. I recommend: "PROCEED to Phase 2 - solid foundation"

**Remember:** Validation is not just "does it compile" - it's "is it production-quality and maintainable". Take time to validate properly; it prevents technical debt later!
