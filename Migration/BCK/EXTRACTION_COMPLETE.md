## Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Start Working on feature/slang-integration

```powershell
cd C:\dev\ChameleonRT
git checkout feature/slang-integration  # Already done!
```

### 2. Copy Migration Files to Project Structure

```powershell
# Copy utility files
Copy-Item Migration\util\slang_shader_compiler.h util\
Copy-Item Migration\util\slang_shader_compiler.cpp util\

# FindSlang.cmake already exists in cmake/, but verify it's current
# Compare Migration\cmake\FindSlang.cmake with cmake\FindSlang.cmake
```

### 3. Update Root CMakeLists.txt

Follow instructions in `Migration/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` Part 1:
- Add `ENABLE_SLANG` option
- Create `slang_compiler_util` library
- Add DLL deployment

Reference file: `Migration/reference/root_CMakeLists.txt`

### 4. Test CMake Configuration

```powershell
cmake -B build_test -DENABLE_SLANG=ON -DSlang_ROOT=C:\dev\slang\build\Debug

# Should see:
# -- Found Slang: ...
# -- Configuring done
```

### 5. Build Utility Library

```powershell
cmake --build build_test --target slang_compiler_util

# Should compile without errors
```

### 6. Integrate into DXR Backend

Follow `Migration/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` Part 2 & 3:
- Update `backends/dxr/CMakeLists.txt`
- Include header in DXR shader compilation code
- Replace DXC calls with `SlangShaderCompiler`

### 7. Test with Simple Shader

```powershell
cmake --build build_test --config Debug
cd build_test\Debug
.\chameleonrt.exe dxr ..\..\..\test_cube.obj

# Should render correctly through Slang-compiled HLSL→DXIL
```

### 8. Repeat for Vulkan Backend

Same process as DXR but for Vulkan:
- GLSL → SPIRV through Slang
- Test with RenderDoc

### 9. Migrate to Slang Language

Once pass-through works:
- Write first `.slang` shader
- Compile to both DXIL and SPIRV
- Validate cross-platform

## Decision Points

### 🚦 After Step 5 (CMake builds utility)
**Question:** Does it compile and link correctly?
- ✅ **Yes** → Proceed to backend integration
- ❌ **No** → Check `Migration/reference/integration_notes.txt` for common issues

### 🚦 After Step 7 (DXR pass-through working)
**Question:** Does rendering work through Slang?
- ✅ **Yes** → Proceed to Vulkan
- ❌ **No** → Compare DXIL output, check diagnostics, review INTEGRATION_GUIDE

### 🚦 After Step 8 (Vulkan pass-through working)
**Question:** Ready for Slang language?
- ✅ **Yes** → Start Phase 2 (Slang shaders)
- ❌ **No** → Investigate issues, keep pass-through for now

## Timeline Estimate

Based on the migration plan:

- **Today:** Copy files, update CMake (2-3 hours)
- **Tomorrow:** DXR integration (4-6 hours)
- **This Week:** Vulkan integration (4-6 hours)
- **Next Week:** First Slang shader (2-3 hours)
- **Weeks 3-6:** Ray tracing shader migration (incremental)

**Total to working pass-through:** 1-2 days  
**Total to first Slang shader:** 1-2 weeks  
**Total to full migration:** 6-8 weeks

## Key Files to Read (In Order)

1. **Start Here:** `Migration/README.md` - Overview
2. **Understand Why:** `Migration/LEARNINGS.md` - Context for decisions
3. **Big Picture:** `Migration/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Overall strategy
4. **Hands-On:** `Migration/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step instructions
5. **Quick Reference:** `Migration/reference/integration_notes.txt` - Tips & tricks

## Success Criteria

You'll know the migration is successful when:

- ✅ CMake finds Slang and builds utility library
- ✅ HLSL compiles to DXIL through Slang (D3D12)
- ✅ GLSL compiles to SPIRV through Slang (Vulkan)
- ✅ Rendering output identical to before
- ✅ No validation errors
- ✅ First `.slang` shader works on both D3D12 and Vulkan
- ✅ Performance within 5% of baseline

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. **Check `getLastError()`** - Slang provides good error messages
2. **Verify DLL deployment** - 90% of runtime issues are missing DLLs
3. **Review `integration_notes.txt`** - Common issues documented
4. **Compare with reference files** - Working examples in `Migration/reference/`
5. **Check migration plan** - Might be skipping a validation step

## Commands Cheat Sheet

```powershell
# Switch to integration branch
git checkout feature/slang-integration

# Build with Slang enabled
cmake -B build -DENABLE_SLANG=ON -DSlang_ROOT=C:\dev\slang\build\Debug
cmake --build build --config Debug

# Run with DXR
.\build\Debug\chameleonrt.exe dxr test_cube.obj

# Run with Vulkan
.\build\Debug\chameleonrt.exe vulkan test_cube.obj

# Check Slang version
& "$env:SLANG_PATH\bin\slangc.exe" --version
```

## What's Different from SlangBackend?

| Aspect | SlangBackend | feature/slang-integration |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Base | slang-gfx experiment | Clean master |
| Abstraction | slang-gfx (GFX library) | Direct APIs only |
| Pipeline Creation | Abstract (via GFX) | Native D3D12/Vulkan |
| Slang Usage | Compiler + GFX | Compiler only |
| Goal | Evaluate slang-gfx | Production integration |
| Migration Package | Present | Present (cherry-picked) |
